# python-api-challenge

This challenge contains two exercises; weather challenge and the vacation challenge The weather part involved making series of weather calls to request the weather information of over 600 cities using the weather api The cities were then convereted to a Pandas DataFrame This challenge were divided into three different parts The first part of the challenge contains various scatter graghs displaying various data in the dataset and date and their images - were saved in a png files. The first scatter plot displays the Latitude and the Max Temperature The second scatter plot shows the Latitude and the Humidity The third scatter plot displays the Latitude agaunst the Wind Speed The fourth scatter pot shows the Latitude and the Cloudness

The second part however, contains the Linear Regression of both the Northern and southern Hemisphere The first scatter plot displays the Northern-Hemisphere Latitude and Max Temperature Linear Regression and the R-value The second scatter plot displays the Southern-Hemisphere Latitude and Max Temperature Linear Regression and the R-value The third one displays the Northern-Hemisphere Latitude and Humidity Linear Regression and the R-value The fourth scatter plot displays the Southern-Hemisphere Humidity and Latitude Linear Regression and the R-value While the fifth one displays the Northern-Hemisphere Latitude and Wind Speed Linear Regression and the R-value The sixth scatter plot displays the Southern-Hemisphere Latitude and Wind Speed Linear Regression and the R-value The seventh scatter plot displays the Northern-Hemisphere Cloudness and Latitude Linear Regression and the R-value The eight scatter plot displays the Southern-Hemisphere Cloudness and Latitude Linear Regression and the R-value

The vacation challenege involved creating a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from the weather challenge The dataset from the first part of this challenge was then filtered in order to create an ideal weather for vacation - using the following conditions ; A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70. Wind speed less than 10 mph. Zero cloudiness. Rows that did not meet these conditions were dropped Google Places API was used to find the first hotel for each city located within 5,000 meters of our coordinates. The hotels were then plotted on top of the humidity heatmap, with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country
